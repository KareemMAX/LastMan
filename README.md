## About the game

The Last Man is a game about exploring space developed mainly during [NASA Space Apps 2020](https://2020.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/create/breakthrough/teams/game-of-throws/project) hackathon, it was developed in 48 hours as a functional prototype. The main goal of the game was to make players learn more about propulsion technologies and spread awareness about this science.

Our team got awarded the **Create category winner** in [Nasa Space Apps Cairo](https://www.facebook.com/spaceappscairo/photos/ms.c.eJw1zNkNADEIA9GOVsTGHP03Fi0Kv0~_aIdzRp9GGTq~_PAy4HAwVbyDNgfBBVfwLhQWYqWsVNUhiQFjgPOS~_S8RgB.bps.a.3244291512363123/3244297525695855).

The *Last Man* will use different spacecrafts and engines to complete his mission, these spacecrafts will be collected from different places and will be made in different periods of human propulsion innovation.

## Game mechanics
